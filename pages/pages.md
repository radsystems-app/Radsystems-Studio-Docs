# Pages
RadSystem Studio pages are the core of application development. The pages panel is divided into four sections:
* Database Tables
* Table Pages
* Table Page Fields
* Table Page Properties
## Database Tables Section

1. According to the graph, on the left side of the panel you can find the direct access to the tree database tables, in addition to the views created. You can create your own views too.
2. There is a three button menu. the first one allows you to change the details of the connection to the database.
3. The next button allows you to manage the Database. Through the interface, you can add, duplicate or delete tables and, for each table, you can manage the fields as well as the field type, size and other properties.
4. The last button synchronizes the database updating all the changes that have occurred through the Database manager.
## Table Pages Section
By default, RadSystem Studio creates interfaces (pages) for managing each table in the Database. What is generally known as CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete), can be seen in 5 pages: One to list the records, one to see the details of each record, one to Add Records, one to Edit Records and, finally, one to Delete a Record.

The Section also offers three buttons for managing the pages:
1. The first button in the section allows you to add a custom page to the project. Among the options in the window, we can choose the name of the page, the type of page (List, Add, Edit or View). If we have a menu configured, we can also choose if the shortcut to be created is a submenu of the main one or if it is created as an independent access in the main menu.
2. The second button allows you to duplicate the selected page.
3. There is also a button for direct access to the page design.
