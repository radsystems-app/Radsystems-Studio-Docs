## Windows Install
For a full installation on a clean version of Windows 10, follow the steps below:

1. Install a WAMP solution (Windows, Apache, MySQL and PHP). WAMP is a set of services that allows you to display your website locally. If you are an expert developer, you can also install each application individually or, if you are a LARAVEL developer, you will feel more comfortable using LARAGON which fully automates the installation process including NODEJS and NPM (**Node Package Manager**).
> Stack WAMP solutions you can use: [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html), [AMPPS](https://ampps.com/) or [WAMPSERVER](https://www.wampserver.com/en/) among others.
