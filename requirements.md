# Requirements

In order to install RADSYSTEMS Studio and be able to use it properly, you must start with some pre-configurations. For example, if you plan to use the Vue.js version, you should start by installing an Apache server that is compatible with PHP, for example XAMPP or Laragon. If you are a Laravel developer, you may be more interested in using Laragon since it contains very good custom tools and they speed up the installation process and use of these projects a bit more, but you can still use XAMPP. Both servers serve the same way.
