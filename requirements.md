# Operating System
Radsystems Studio currently supports only the **Windows Operating System(OS)**, **Windows x86/x64 (7, 8, 10, 11)**. You can download the OS from the [Microsoft Website](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/). For those using other operating systems, you will need to install a **Virtual Machine (VM)** and then install the supported windows OS to that **Virtual Machine (VM)** in order to install **Radsystems Studio** in it.
- [VirtualBox (MacOS, Linux, Solaris)](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) 
- [Wine (Linux, MacOS, Android)](https://wiki.winehq.org/Download)
- [Parallels Desktop (MacOS)](https://www.parallels.com/)

- [CrossOver (ChromeOS, MacOS, Linux)](https://www.codeweavers.com/crossover/)

These are just a few options out there.
